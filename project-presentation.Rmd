## Background | Exploring the gig economy {.build}
- The U.S. workforce is increasingly participating in what is known as the "gig economy"
- The gig economy allows workers to easily find quick, temporary jobs
- While these new labor models create more income opportunities, how do they impact or disrupt current industries and labor markets?

> - For our project, we proposed examining the impact of the gig economy through a case study using data provided by New York City's Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)

## Background {.smaller}
<div class="columns-2">
NYC's TLC published .csv files on trip record data
![](images/tlc-webpage.png)
![](images/tlc-files.png)
</div>


## Research Design/Approach 

> - Build our own consolidated dataset using trip record data from the TLC using data wrangling techniques from `tidyverse` (`dplyr` and `tidyr` grammar) and `purrr` packages. This involved taking the data from:

        raw -> processed
        altering the unit of analysis
  
> - Once we had the dataset together, we planned to conduct some exploratory data analysis (EDA) using 'ggplot2' from the tidyverse package and potentially look at relationships between green/yellow taxis versus FHV's as they began to enter the market

> - We realized quickly though that the data was constructed for a different purpose and that most of our time would be spent building a dataset that could be used for our analysis


## Research Design/Approach {.smaller}
Huge file sizes

![text](images/trip-files.png)


## Methods and Tools {.build}
We used functions from several packages including `readr`, `tidyverse`, `recipes`, `plyr`, and base R. 

* <span style = "color:blue2">Data processing and cleaning</span>
  + 1 Read the data in using `readr`*
  + 2 Select and rename relevant variables using `select` and `add_column` to create new variables
  + 3 Mutate and transform variables 
  + 4 Aggregate data up to a month (altering unit of analysis)
  + 5 Combine all files (month and vehicle type) using `list.files` and `plyr`

* Exploratory Data Analysis 
  + Once our data set was built, we were finally able to begin exploring the data with `ggplot2`

## Methods and Tools {.smaller}
Variables  | Aggregation
------------- | -------------
pickup_date  | Rounded to month, year
dropoff_date  | Rounded to month, year
passenger_count  | Mean of passenger count
payment type factor variables  | Sum of each factor variable
trip_distance  | Mean of trip distance
total_fare | Mean of total fare
trip | Mode of trip
trip_n | Count (# of trips by month)

## Methods and Tools {.smaller}
We used `group_by` to aggregate the data up to a month which also meant that we needed to `summarise` all of our variables at that level.

        yellow_monthly <- yellow_clean %>%
          mutate(pickup_date = round_date(pickup_date, unit = "month"),
                 dropoff_date = round_date(dropoff_date, unit = "month")) %>%
          group_by(month, year, vehicle_type) %>%
          summarise(mean_passenger_count= mean(passenger_count), 
                    payment_credit = sum(payment_credit),
                    payment_cash = sum(payment_cash),
                    payment_no_charge = sum(payment_no_charge),
                    payment_dispute = sum(payment_dispute),
                    mean_trip_distance = mean(trip_distance),
                    mean_total_fare = mean(total_fare),
                    trip = mode(trip),
                    trip_n = n()) %>% 
          na.omit() %>%
          filter(year==2018 & month==1)`

## Next steps for future work {.build}
Our project presented many challenges related to file sizes, missing data, incomplete or inaccurate data, and also inconsistent variables across files.

- FHVs did not collect the same information as yellow and green taxis. One area for improvement would be to find other data sources to use for FHV/Rideshare data to eventually combine or compare with the yellow/green taxi cab data.

- We chose to aggregate by `month`, `year`, and `vehicle type`. One potential change to our approach could be to also aggregate the data by trip location. This would allow us to conduct some geographic analysis.

- Another topic for further research is whether FHVs have increased congestion in NYC overall.
